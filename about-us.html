2. **Branches:** Git makes it easy to create, use, and manage branches. Branching allows developers to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work without affecting the main codebase.

3. **Commits:** Changes in the code are recorded in snapshots called commits. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash) and includes metadata such as the author, timestamp, and commit message.

4. **Merging:** Git supports merging branches back together. If multiple developers work on different branches, their changes can be merged together.

5. **Rebase:** Git allows rebasing, which lets you move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. This can make the commit history cleaner and more linear.

6. **Staging Area:** Before committing changes, Git uses a staging area (or index) to keep track of changes that will be included in the next commit.

7. **Remote Repositories:** Git can work with remote repositories, allowing developers to push their local commits to a remote server and pull updates from others.

8. **Collaboration:** Git supports collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. Tools like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide additional features for managing repositories and collaborating on projects.
