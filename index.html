Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to support the development of the Linux kernel. Here are some key features and concepts of Git:

1. **Distributed Version Control:** Unlike centralized version control systems, Git allows ever++y developer to have a full copy of the entire repository, including the entire history of changes.


### Basic Git Commands

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
- `git clone [url]`: Clones an existing repository from a remote server.
- `git add [file]`: Stages a file for the next commit.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git status`: Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
- `git push`: Pushes local commits to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.
- `git branch`: Lists, creates, or deletes branches.
- `git checkout [branch]`: Switches to a specified branch.
- `git merge [branch]`: Merges a specified branch into the current branch.

These features and commands make Git a powerful tool for version control, enabling efficient and effective collaboration in software development projects.
